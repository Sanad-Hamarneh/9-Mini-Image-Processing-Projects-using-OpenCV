# 🧠 9 Mini Image Processing Projects using OpenCV

A collection of Python mini-projects demonstrating key computer vision and time series techniques using OpenCV, NumPy, matplotlib, and more.

---

## 🛣️ Project 1 – Road Image Processing  
Basic OpenCV operations: load, crop, grayscale/RGB conversion, and shape extraction.

---

## 🧠 Project 2 – Template Matching with SSIM  
Detects fruits like 🥦 and 🍎 using SSIM-based template matching and sliding windows.

> **Tools:** OpenCV, skimage, imutils

---

## 🔢 Project 3 – Digit Detection (Template Matching)  
Detects the digit "3" using template matching and Non-Max Suppression.

> **Tools:** OpenCV, NumPy

---

## 🎯 Project 4 – Scaled & Rotated Template Matching  
Matches a circular shape across rotations and scales using a sliding window.

> **Tools:** OpenCV, imutils, matplotlib

---

## 🧮 Project 5 – Edge-Based Matching with MSE  
Matches the digit "8" using edge detection and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

> **Tools:** OpenCV, scikit-image, NumPy

---

## 🧩 Project 6 – Shape Matching with SIFT  
Detects and matches geometric shapes using SIFT keypoints and descriptors.

> **Tools:** OpenCV (SIFT), NumPy

---

## 🧱 Project 7 – Contour Detection & Shuffling  
Extracts shapes using contours and randomly reorders them in a new layout.

> **Tools:** OpenCV, matplotlib

---

## 🚗 Project 8 – Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv3  
Detects and labels real-time objects (e.g., cars, people) using YOLOv3 on video.

> **Tools:** OpenCV, YOLOv3, COCO

---

## 📈 Project 9 – Time Series Pattern Recognition  
Detects shape patterns in 20 years of gold price data using sliding windows and correlation.

> **Tools:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib
